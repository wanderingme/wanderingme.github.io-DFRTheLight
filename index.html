<p class="p5"><span class="s1">The point of the game is to find and blow out all five candles in order within the time limit, then exit the same way you entered through the gate at the beginning of the game. At the start, you will be presented with five symbol tablets in random order. It is crucial to remember the order of the symbols. Once the game begins, a map will appear in the lower left-hand side with the symbols corresponding with the location of the candles. You must go to each location and search for the candles in order. If you blow the candles out of order, you’ll be punished with a temporary in-game hinderance that will make finishing the game difficult.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p6"><span class="s1"><b>The ghost keeps killing me! Is it cheating?</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">No, the game is meant to be very challenging. If you find yourself dying a lot, and you will, then try switching up your strategy. Remember, the ghost is always hunting you. This means it’s listening and looking at all times. It’s best to avoid it at all costs, especially when moving around. If you hear it, it can hear you — especially if you run! Crouching near the ghost gives you two advantages: 1) You are less visible, and 2) you’re much quieter. Of course, you are also much slower. It’s best to vary your speeds depending on your proximity to it. It’s also important to note that the ghost becomes increasingly more aggressive as time passes and the candles left become fewer.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">Blow out all five candles and exit the way you entered. This is no easy feat, however.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">D.F.R.: The Light is not a casual game. It is meant to be scary, especially the first few times playing while learning the game mechanics. However, over time you’ll find the gameplay to be rewarding, yet intense, as you discover strategies to get further in the game.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>Where did you get all the models and other assets?</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">To see all the wonderful and talented people or companies that contributed to the creation of this game, please select “Credits” from the main menu. Games like this wouldn’t be possible without the efforts of people and companies like them. Respect!</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1"><b>What are the controls?</b></span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s1">In the menu screen, you can select “Controls” from the menu and view the control arrangement there. But, briefly, the controls are standard for most first-person games: W-A-S-D to move, mouse to look, E for action, SHIFT to run, etc. However, there’s no jump in this game, so use the SPACE (or SHIFT) to crouch.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s1">This is my very first game made in Unity.</span></p>
